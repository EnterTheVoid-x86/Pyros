# Welcome to Pyros!
Pyros is an "operating system" made in Python. It supports basic features and custom programs using Python scripts. It uses only Python Standard Libraries for everything it does.

- If you're on Windows, Pyros should be ran from PowerShell in something like conhost or Windows Terminal. Thanks!
